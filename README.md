# Recruitment Technical Tests

Often as part of the contractor recruitment process, I am given a 
technical test or "homework" assignment. This allows me to demonstrate 
basic technical competence (to the fizzbuzz standard) whilst also 
providing a talking point during the interview. I find them quite fun.

Interview is a two way process and what I have discovered is that 
the ability to set a good technical test says alot about a company.
